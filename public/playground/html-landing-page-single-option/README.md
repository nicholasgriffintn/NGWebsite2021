# HTML Responsive Landing Page

This is a HTML landing page that is reponsive and features one options for selection.

I did make another version of this landing page with a single option, which you can find here: https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/html-landing-page-double-option

If you prefer just one, here's a look at this project:
