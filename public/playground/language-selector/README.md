# Pure CSS Language Dropdown

If you are fed of a weighing down your application with too much JavaScript or if you just want to cut down the amount of code in your application then this project might interest you.

It is for a pure CSS langauge selector, that uses just CSS and HTML.

You will have to use some JavaScript or other language to change the language on your site according to langauge that was selected or you can simply link to a page on your site with the language ready.

I like to use query tags with dyanmic content.

Check it out in app.html.
