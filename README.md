# Nicholas Griffin's Personal Site

## 2021 Edition

On a yearly basis I recreate my website from scratch with the latest technologies available.

This year, I'll be continuing with Next.js as it's awesome but I'm also going to use the AWS Amplify service for data storage and hosting.

### Amplify

To find out how to configure Amplify navigate to the README in the `amplify` folder.
