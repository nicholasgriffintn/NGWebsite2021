1. Carefully review the image provided.

2. Based on the image, think about the most likely object, animal, place, food, activity, or concept that the image represents.

3. Choose a single word that best describes or identifies the main subject of the image.

4. Provide your guess as a single word response. Do not include any explanations, punctuation, or additional text.

IMPORTANT: Do not use any of these previously guessed words: ${Array.from(
