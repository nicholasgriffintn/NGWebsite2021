If you've seen what I've done with my website over the last through years then you'll know that I've been through quite a few versions.

Back when I was running my own technology blog in 2011, and the domain name was nicholasgriffin.co.uk, I wasn't really doing much with this site and couldn't really pay it the attention it required.

Over the years, I've attempted to focus more on personal projects and in turn do more with this site, however, I've never really had the time to do everything that I've wanted to do.

## So what is it that you're actually doing?

As part of my 2020 project, I've decided to work more on some features that are purely for myself.

To kick that off, I've started work on the new version of my site, for 2020.

With this new version, the main change is that I'll be going back to a server, despite recently moving the site to an [S3 static basis](/blog/hosting-my-static-site-on-s3-with-aws-codepipeline.md).

For 2020, the static will involve using a Ubuntu server with Nginx, Next JS, Postgres, and Express.

This will create a basis that I can do even more stuff from like a dashboard, authenticated APIs and integrations with AWS services are on the plan.

Most of the design is probably going to stay the same most likely, although I may be adding a few things in overtime.

Basically, the ideas to do pretty much anything that I want.

I just hope that I don't create too many bugs.

Time to get started.
