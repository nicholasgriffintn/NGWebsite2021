Earlier today, Hugging Face announced the release of their new family of 2B small vision language models, SmolVLM.

Hugging Face say that these new models can be used commerically and are targeted towards smaller, local setups. It includes three new models:

SmolVLM-Base for downstream fine-tuning, SmolVLM-Sythetic as a fine-tuned variant on sythetic data and SmolVLM Instruct, which has been fine tuned for instructions.

A [demo of Instruct can be found here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM) and there's also some [performance metrics here](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolvlm#performance).
