title: 'Building a quick tool to compare AI image generations'
description: In a single project that I've been working on, I've been building a tool that allows users to generate images based on their content or prompts. This seemed to work great in quite a few cases, however, we found that in some cases, the images were not as good as we expected, so I needed a tool to compare the images generated by different models in order to see if there was a single model that could be used instead, or if it was better to use a combination of models.

^ That's it!

It's quite a simple tool that allows the user to compare the output of a number of models, using the same prompt, from a single button press.

When submitted, the tool will asynchronously generate images from the models with Cloudflare AI, as it does so, it will record stats such as how long it took to generate the image, the quality of the image, and the model that generated it.

It also provides the ability for the user to vote on the images, which will be used to figure out which one worked the best.

Aside from the capability that this is going to provide, the interesting thing with this project is that it was all generated using Anthropic's Claude AI. Starting off with this prompt:

> I want to build a new Python app, this Python app should generate images from 6 pre-defined prompts against a number of AI models provided.
>
> It should store the images in an S3 bucket and provide a frontend to view them.
>
> It should also store metadata on the requests to the AI tool such as how long it took and how correct the image is, there should be graphs and metadata sections on the frontend to display this.

And then building it out with a few additional prompts to get it to do stuff like use fastAPI and Tailwind, after that it was just a case of setting up [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) and a bit of config. Clearly, these tools are now really good at generating these one time tools, and I'm all for it as in the past, this probably wouldn't have been anywhere near as expansive.
