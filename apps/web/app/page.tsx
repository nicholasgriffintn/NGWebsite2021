								Thanks for visiting my site! As you might have read in the title,
								my name is Nicholas Griffin and I am a Senior Software Engineer,
								Blogger and Technology enthusiast from the UK.
							</p>

								Feel free to scroll further down to find out more about me or my

							<h3 className="text-1xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-primary-foreground">About me</h3>
							<p>
								I would classify myself as a Full Stack Developer with a slight
								bias towards frontend. I spend most of my dev time doing a range
								of personal development projects around the web alongside my day
								job.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of development, I enjoy the odd read and love to listen to
								music, with an aim to find some good new stuff, however, that's
								mostly about trying to beat the algorithm.
							</p>
							<p>You can find out more about me and my projects below.</p>
